# jsx-double-quotes README

This extention automatically adds double quotes after writing `=` in jsx. Borrowed from webstorm. Made from a fork of ImExoOdeex/jsx-brackets which adds curly braces after writing `=` in jsx.

Run with
  pnpm install
  pnpm run compile
  vsce package
Then install extension from VSIX
